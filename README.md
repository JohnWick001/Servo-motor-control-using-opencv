# Servo-motor-control-using-opencv
OpenCV is used to capture real time video and Media Pipe for getting region-of-interest (ROI) within  the frame. Then, using NumPy and math modules, I can calculate the distance and angle of the pose  landmarks, convert the pixel thresholds to servo motor thresholds, and send it to Arduino to drive the  servo motor.
